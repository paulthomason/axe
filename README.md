# Axe Throwing Challenge

This repository hosts a small HTML5 canvas game. Press **SPACEBAR** or tap the on-screen button to stop each slider and throw the axe at the target.

## Files
- `index.html` contains all markup, styles, and game logic.
- `axe.png` is the axe sprite used by the game.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The layout automatically adapts to different screen sizes so you can play on phones, tablets or desktops. No build or installation steps are required.

During play you can slow the sliders once with the **BULLET TIME** button and unleash five random throws with the one-time **AXE BARRAGE** ability.

## Running tests
Install dependencies with `npm install` then run `npm test`. All tests should report "All tests passed".
